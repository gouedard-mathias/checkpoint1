# PHP checkpoint 1

* To run the checkpoint, you have to create a connec.php file 
(you can use connec.php.dist as a model)
* Launch the PHP internal server with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
* Follow the instructions on the home page carefully.
* Commit your changes on a branch named as **CAMPUS_NOM_Prenom** *(i.e. NANTES_LEGUENEC_Erwan)*
